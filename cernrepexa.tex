\begin{abstract}
The planed Future Circular Collider will operate first as a lepton collider in an $e^+e^-$ mode, the FCC-ee.
In contrast to the Large Hadron Collider, the current energy-frontier machine, the FCC-ee will have precise control on the center-of-mass energy to below the 0.2\% level.
Therefore, a high-precision inner tracking detector with transverse momentum resolution on the order of 0.2\% is required to fully take advantage of the clean collider environment.
Existing detector concepts to meet these needs include the IDEA drift chamber and the CLD silicon tracker.
However, we study a third option: a thin-wall straw tube tracker.
Such a tracker could offer lower material budget than a full silicon detector and improved particle identification compared to a drift chamber.
In this note we briefly present an overview of the detector concept and its possible advantages and flexibility before presenting a detailed accounting of simulation studies and geometric optimization of the detector layout.

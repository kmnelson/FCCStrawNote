The Future Circular Collider (FCC) \cite{FCCeeconcept,fccatcern} is a planned collider experiment which will have a lepton colliding stage, FCC-ee, at center-of-mass energies to cover the $Z$ pole as well as $WW$, $ZH$ and $t\bar{t}$ production.
Existing detector concepts include ALLEGRO \cite{allegroconcept}, IDEA \cite{ideaconcept,idea2}, and CLD \cite{cldconcept}.
